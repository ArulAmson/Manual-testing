Sure! Based on the information you've provided about the "Nil Value Issuance" with mandatory checkboxes (Yes/No), I'll format the test case in the format you requested.

Here's the test case for this scenario:

SNO	Test Scenario-ID	Test Scenario	Test Module	Test Sub Module	Test Case	Expected Result	Actual Result	Result/ Bug ID If Failed	Result/ Bug ID If Passed
1	TS_22	Nil Value Issuance Checkboxes	Nil Value Issuance	Checkbox Validation	Verify that the checkboxes for "Yes" and "No" are present and are mandatory.	Both "Yes" and "No" checkboxes should be visible and marked as mandatory fields. User must select one option to proceed.	Both checkboxes present, and "Yes" and "No" are mandatory.		Passed
2	TS_23	Nil Value Issuance - Yes Option Selected	Nil Value Issuance	Checkbox Validation	Select the "Yes" checkbox for Nil Value Issuance.	The "Yes" checkbox should be selected, and the form should allow the user to proceed.	"Yes" checkbox selected.		Passed
3	TS_24	Nil Value Issuance - No Option Selected	Nil Value Issuance	Checkbox Validation	Select the "No" checkbox for Nil Value Issuance.	The "No" checkbox should be selected, and the form should allow the user to proceed.	"No" checkbox selected.		Passed
4	TS_25	Nil Value Issuance - No Selection	Nil Value Issuance	Checkbox Validation	Do not select either checkbox ("Yes" or "No").	The system should show an error or prompt that one checkbox must be selected as this is a mandatory field.	Error prompt displayed for mandatory checkbox selection.	Bug #001	
Explanation of Each Test Case:
Test Case TS_22: Verify that both "Yes" and "No" checkboxes are visible and mandatory. The user cannot proceed without selecting one of them.
Test Case TS_23: Test selecting the "Yes" checkbox. Once selected, the form should allow the user to proceed.
Test Case TS_24: Test selecting the "No" checkbox. Once selected, the form should allow the user to proceed.
Test Case TS_25: Test case where neither checkbox is selected. The system should display an error or a prompt indicating that one of the options must be selected.
Next Steps for You:
Test Execution: Execute these test cases on the system and record the actual results in your test management tool or spreadsheet.
Bug Tracking: If any test fails (e.g., Test Case TS_25), make sure to log the issue in your bug tracking system (e.g., JIRA) and update the Bug ID accordingly.
Pass/Fail Status: Mark the result as Passed or Failed for each test case and update the Excel document accordingly.
This format follows your requested structure and can be used to document the results once you've tested this functionality. If any issues arise during testing, please provide the relevant bug ID.

Explanation of Each Test Case:
Test Case TS_26: Card Type - Perso Checkbox

Verify that the "Perso" checkbox is visible and mandatory. The user cannot proceed without selecting one of the options ("Perso" or "Non-Perso").
Test Case TS_27: Card Type - Non-Perso Checkbox

Verify that the "Non-Perso" checkbox is visible and mandatory. The user cannot proceed without selecting one of the options ("Perso" or "Non-Perso").

Select the "Yes" checkbox for "Backup Card Needed?" after selecting the "Perso" checkbox. The system should accept this and allow the user to proceed.
Test Case TS_30: Card Type - Backup Card - No Selected

Select the "No" checkbox for "Backup Card Needed?" after selecting the "Perso" checkbox. The system should accept this and allow the user to proceed.
Test Case TS_31: Card Type - No Selection for Backup Card

Do not select either the "Yes" or "No" checkbox for "Backup Card Needed?" after selecting the "Perso" checkbox. The system should show an error or prompt indicating that one checkbox must be selected.
Next Steps for You:
Test Execution: Execute each test case on your application and record the actual results in your test management tool or spreadsheet.
Bug Tracking: If any test fails (e.g., Test Case TS_31), log the issue in your bug tracking system (e.g., JIRA) and update the Bug ID accordingly.
Pass/Fail Status: Mark the result as Passed or Failed for each test case and update the Excel document accordingly.
Conclusion:
This set of test cases covers the functionality for the Card Type field (with "Perso" and "Non-Perso" checkboxes) and validates the Backup Card Needed? options. You can now proceed with running these tests and document the results as you go. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
